patient-related baseline characteristics. The lines show the predicted
number of overprescribed medicines (i.e., medicines with reduced dosage
or discontinuation at first visit) for different combinations of all the
variables that were statistically significant in both the full and
univariate models. The full model was a generalized linear model with
quasi-Poisson distribution (log link) including all patient-related
baseline characteristics without near-zero variance.</div>
