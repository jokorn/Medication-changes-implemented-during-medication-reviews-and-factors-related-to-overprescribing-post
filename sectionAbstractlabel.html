<h1 data-label="abstract" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="abstract" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div><b>Aims:</b> To describe the medication changes implemented during
physician-led medication reviews that resulted in improved
health-related quality of life; and to explore factors that could
identify patients with overprescription.</div><div><b>Methods:</b> Post-hoc analyses of data from a pragmatic,
non-blinded, randomized clinical trial investigating a medication review
intervention
(NCT03911934) in
408 geriatric outpatients taking ≥9 medicines.</div><div><b>Results:</b> The most frequent medicine change in the medication
review group (n=196) was discontinuation (26% of the medicines) due to
lack of indication (72% of the discontinuations). After 13 months, 82%
of the discontinued medicines were persistently discontinued. The
medicines most often discontinued in the medication review group
compared with usual care included: metoclopramide (11/5=73%
discontinued vs 1/12=8% in usual care), acetylsalicylic acid
(20/48=42% vs 2/47=4%), simvastatin (18/48=38% vs 2/58=3%),
zopiclone (23/59=39% vs 4/54=7%), quinine (9/14=64% vs 6/16=38%),
citalopram (4/18=22% vs 0/20=0%), and tramadol (18/37=49% vs
8/30=27%). Factors associated with the number of overprescribed
medicines included: number of prescribed medicines (8% increase per
medicine), Drug Burden Index (15% increase per 1 increase), and patient
motivation for medicine changes (26% less if not motivated).
Prescriptions of metoclopramide, iron preparations, antidepressants
other than SSRIs, NSAIDs, or drugs for urinary incontinence were
associated with a higher number of overprescribed medicines.</div><div><b>Conclusion:</b> Medication reviews can be used to persistently
discontinue overprescribed medicines in older polypharmacy patients.
Motivation for having their medicine changed, treatment with a higher
number of medicines, and a higher burden of sedative and anticholinergic
drugs characterized patients most likely to benefit from physician-led
medication reviews.</div>
