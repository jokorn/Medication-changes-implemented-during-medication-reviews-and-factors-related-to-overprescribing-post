<h1 data-label="tables" class="ltx_title_section">Tables</h1><div>Table 1: Changes to the medicine and persistence of changes. For the
change to be persistent, the medicine must be prescribed at the same
dosage at follow-up as after the first visit. This means that if e.g., a
medicine is reduced in dosage at the first visit and then discontinued
at 4 months, then the change is not persistent.&nbsp;    Medicine data is only available for patients that were alive at follow-up. When calculating the proportion of persistent changes, the denominator is therefore not identical to the number of changes at first visit.&nbsp;    <i>Other change</i> includes changes in medicines with multiple prescriptions with the same substance(s) where the changes are in opposite directions, e.g. reducing regular and increasing as-needed at the same time.</div><div> </div><div></div>
