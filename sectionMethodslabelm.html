<h1 data-label="methods" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>All results in this paper are post-hoc analyses of data from a
pragmatic, non-blinded, single-center, randomized clinical trial with
follow-up 4 months and 13 months after the initial visit. For a detailed
description of the trial see the primary publication.<sup>3</sup> Briefly, participants taking 9 or more different medicines were
recruited from the geriatric outpatient clinic at Copenhagen University
Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg from June 2017 to December 2019.
Participants were randomized to usual care or usual care plus a
medication consultation including a medication review and increased
cross-sectoral communication (termed the medication review group). The
medication reviews were prepared and implemented by a physician from the
Department of Clinical Pharmacology. Proposed changes to the medicine
were discussed with the patientâ€™s primary care physician and the
treating geriatrician before an in-person consultation with the patient
where the changes were implemented if the patient agreed to the changes.
All included participants provided written, informed consent to the
collection of data and the study was approved by the Danish Data
Protection Agency (BFH-2017-031).</div>
