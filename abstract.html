<b>Aims:</b> To describe the medication changes implemented during
physician-led medication reviews that resulted in improved
health-related quality of life; and to explore factors that could
identify patients with overprescription.&nbsp;<b>Methods:</b> Post-hoc
analyses of data from a pragmatic, non-blinded, randomized clinical
trial investigating a medication review intervention (NCT03911934) in
408 geriatric outpatients taking â‰¥9 medicines.</div><div><b>Results:</b> The
most frequent medicine change in the medication review group (n=196) was
discontinuation (26% of the medicines) due to lack of indication (72%
of the discontinuations). After 13 months, 82% of the discontinued
medicines were persistently discontinued. The medicines most often
discontinued in the medication review group compared with usual care
included: metoclopramide (11/5=73% discontinued vs 1/12=8% in usual
care), acetylsalicylic acid (20/48=42% vs 2/47=4%), simvastatin
(18/48=38% vs 2/58=3%), zopiclone (23/59=39% vs 4/54=7%), quinine
(9/14=64% vs 6/16=38%), citalopram (4/18=22% vs 0/20=0%), and
tramadol (18/37=49% vs 8/30=27%). Factors associated with the number
of overprescribed medicines included: number of prescribed medicines
(8% increase per medicine), Drug Burden Index (15% increase per 1
increase), and patient motivation for medicine changes (26% less if not
motivated). Prescriptions of metoclopramide, iron preparations,
antidepressants other than SSRIs, NSAIDs, or drugs for urinary
incontinence were associated with a higher number of overprescribed
medicines.</div><div><b>Conclusion:</b> Medication reviews can be used to
persistently discontinue overprescribed medicines in older polypharmacy
patients. Motivation for having their medicine changed, treatment with a
higher number of medicines, and a higher burden of sedative and
anticholinergic drugs characterized patients most likely to benefit from
physician-led medication reviews.</div>
