<div data-label="907792">    Visualization of the results from the full model using the patient-related baseline characteristics. The lines show the predicted number of overprescribed medicines (i.e., medicines with reduced dosage or discontinuation at first visit) for different combinations of all the variables that were statistically significant in both the full and univariate models. The full model was a generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson distribution (log link) including all patient-related baseline characteristics without near-zero variance.    </div>
