<h1 data-label="results-1" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>The study included 196 patients randomized to medication review and 212
to usual care. The included patients had a median age of 81 years (IQR
75 to 85 years), were prescribed a median of 12 medicines (IQR 10 to 14)
at baseline, and 71% were females. Detailed patient characteristics and
patient flowchart have previously been reported.<sup>3</sup>Medicines prescribed at baseline are listed in Supporting Information
Table S1. As reported in the primary publication,<sup>3</sup>medication review reduced the number of prescribed medicines by 18%
after the first visit, by 16% after 4 months, and by 11% after 13
months compared with 5%, 5% and 2% in the usual care group. The
medicine changes, and their corresponding persistence, that led to these
differences in the number of prescribed medicines are described in
detail in Table <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tbl:tbl1}</span>. The number of overprescribed and underprescribed
medicines as a function of the number of baseline medicines is
visualized in Figure 1. The primary reasons for discontinuations in the
medication review group are listed in Table <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tbl:table2}</span>. The medicines that were
more often discontinued in the medication review group compared with
usual care are listed in Table <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tbl:table3}</span>. The medicines that were most often
restarted after being discontinued in the medication review group are
listed in Table <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tbl:table4}</span>. The proportions of prescribed medicines in
pharmacological subgroups in the two groups at the different time points
are shown in Figure 2. The numbers from the plots in Figure 2 are listed
in Supporting Information Table S2. The factors that predicted the
number of overprescribed medicines in the two models are listed in Table
<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tbl:table5}</span>. The effect of the patient-related factors on predicted number of
overprescribed medicines is visualized in Figure 3. For reference, the
number of overprescribed medicines for patients referred from the
geriatric department was a median (IQR) of 3 (2 to 5) compared with 4 (2
to 6) for patients referred from the GP, and for patients not motivated
for medicine changes 3 (1 to 4) compared with 4 (2 to 6) for patients
motivated for medicine changes.</div>
