<h1 data-label="introduction-1" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Medication reviews are used as a tool to combat inappropriate
polypharmacy and associated adverse effects.<sup>1</sup>I In numerous trials, medication
reviews have decreased the number of potentially inappropriate medicines
and increased the prescribing
appropriateness.<sup>2</sup></div><div>We have previously reported on the clinical effects of medication
reviews as a supplement to usual care in a geriatric outpatient
clinic.<sup>3</sup> In a randomized clinical trial, medication
reviews reduced the number of medicines after 4 months and led to
relative increases in the patientâ€™s health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) and reduced mortality. The combined beneficial effect on HRQoL
and mortality support that the discontinued and dose-reduced medicines
were in fact inappropriate and not merely <i>potentially</i>inappropriate. Thus, a detailed description of these medicines seem
warranted as these medicines could be discontinued in a pragmatic
clinical trial setting and thus are of clinical relevance for medication
reviews in geriatric outpatients.</div><div>The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to provide a detailed
description of the medication changes implemented during medication
reviews to better understand the observed beneficial clinical effects
and to guide future medication review interventions; and 2) to explore
patient- and medication-related factors that may identify patients that
will benefit most from medication reviews. To fulfill these purposes,
the detailed descriptions include: 1) the actual changes to the
medicine; 2) the persistence of the changes; 3) the medicines most often
discontinued; 4) the reasons for discontinuing; 5) the medicines that
most often were prescribed again after discontinuation; and 6) an
exploratory analysis of factors that predicted the number of
overprescribed medicines to help identify patients that may benefit the
most from medication reviews.</div>
