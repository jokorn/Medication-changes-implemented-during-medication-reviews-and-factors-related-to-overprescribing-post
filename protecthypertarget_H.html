<div>Table 5: Factors predicting the
number of overprescribed medicines in the medication review group.
Results from the full and univariate analysis are presented for the
model with patient-related factors and the model with medication-related
factors. All models were
generalized linear models with
quasi-Poisson distribution (log link). The full models included all
medicine groups or all patient-related baseline characteristics without
near-zero variance. Confidence limits and P-values are not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. The exponentiated β is the ratio between the
predicted number of overprescribed medicines for patients “having” the
factor versus patients not “having” the factor (with all other factors
being equal). The reference level (i.e. what is meant by not “having”
the factor) is listed in parentheses for binary and categorical factors.
For example, patients referred from the geriatric department have 74%
(or 26% fewer) the number of overprescribed medicines compared with
patients referred from their GP. For continuous variables, an increase
of one is used, e.g. patients with a Drug Burden Index of 1 have 115%
(or 15% more) overprescribed medicines compared with patients with a
Drug Burden Index of 0, and patients with a Drug Burden Index of 2 have
15% more overprescribed medicines compared with patients with a Drug
Burden Index of 1 (or 115% ×
115% = 132% overprescribed medicines compared with a patient with a
Drug Burden Index of 0).</div><div></div><div></div>
