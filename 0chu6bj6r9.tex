\caption{Changes to the medicine and persistence of changes. For the change to be persistent, the medicine must be prescribed at the same dosage at follow-up as after the first visit. This means that if e.g., a medicine is reduced in dosage at the first visit and then discontinued at 4 months, then the change is not persistent. Medicine data is only available for patients that were alive at follow-up. When calculating the proportion of persistent changes, the denominator is therefore not identical to the number of changes at first visit. \textit{Other change} includes changes in medicines with multiple prescriptions with the same substance(s) where the changes are in opposite directions, e.g. reducing regular and increasing as-needed at the same time.}
